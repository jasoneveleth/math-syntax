## missing:

- '.' composition
- '>=' '>' '<' '<=' comparison
- '==' '!=' && || boolean operators
- {1, 2, 3} sets, vector [1, 2, 3]
- \in \subset \union \intersection \difference \disjoint-union (or +) set ops


## outputs:

- [x] sexp
- [ ] RPN
- [ ] code, like python (explicit *)
- [ ] fully parenthesized


## Justification for why it can't be pretty

The reason we can't do the nice paren thing is every ( needs to consume a ) but we have infix parens, which means we'd need weird logic for that. We can avoid that by consuming on entry to loop and breaking.
