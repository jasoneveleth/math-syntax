# Description

- `infix.py` is a Pratt parser that just does infix
- `prefix.py` adds prefix parsing
- `juxt.py` adds implicit * juxtapose
- `paren.py` adds parethesis grouping and function application

They are meant to be looked at in order using `diff` to see the changes required.
I have spent a lot of time making it as intelligible as possible so hopefully no explanation
is necessary.

Run tests with `python test.py infix prefix juxt paren` or just `python test.py paren`

## missing:

- '>=' '>' '<' '<=' comparison
- '==' '!=' && || boolean operators
- {1, 2, 3} sets, vector [1, 2, 3]
- \in \subset \union \intersection \difference \disjoint-union (or +) set ops

## outputs:

- [x] sexp
- [ ] RPN
- [ ] code, like python (explicit *)
- [ ] fully parenthesized
